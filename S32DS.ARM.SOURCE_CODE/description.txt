This application will show the usage of the FlexCAN module with Flexible Data Rate. 
Using the two buttons it will send data to the second board (noted as "SLAVE") which will toggle the specific LED. 
Also, if the "SLAVE" sends data the board will toggle the LED corresponding to the message received.
The communication between the two nodes can be encrypted. In order to switch to the encrypted mode, the user should press one of the buttons while the other is hold pressed.
Switching to encryption communication shall be done on both nodes.
The example documentation can be found in the S32 SDK documentation at Examples and Demos section. (<SDK_PATH>/doc/Start_Here.html)
